/*
 Debian note:
 This file is based on and replaces the include/config.php file normaly
 found in the cacti source. Most cacti configuration is done via the
 web-interface and stored in a mysql database, however, some things need
 to be defined or can be overwritten here.

 Database access settings are automatically generated from 
 /etc/dbconfig-common/cacti.conf by /usr/sbin/dbconfig-generate-include

 By default this file is managed via ucf, so you shouldn't have to
 worry about manual changes being silently discarded.  *However*,
 you'll probably also want to edit the configuration file mentioned
 above too.
